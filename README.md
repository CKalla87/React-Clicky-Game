# React-Clicky-Game

This application is a memory game using the React framework.

Play the game here: https://ckalla87.github.io/React-Clicky-Game/

1.    Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

2.    Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.

3.    When the game resets your highscore will be saved and the game will reset.

Good luck!
